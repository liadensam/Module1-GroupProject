### General-info
--
This is a website we did for the group project in Module 1. 
At the start of this project we decided to start with a brainstorm to decide what kind of a website we wanted to make. 
We decided on making a website for a made up cinema called Landsbyggðarbíó.
With the decided idea for this project we started collecting visual materials and colors to evoke a certain style to get an idea about how the website should feel. When decided on a moodboard, we did some lo-fi wireframes to figure out the structure of the website and thereafter a hi-fi wireframe that we used to structure our website with. When all members of the group were happy with the final look of the wireframe we started the coding process with a skeleton in html and thereafter started styling with CSS when designing the website.
